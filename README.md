Bring up a terminal by pressing the "Terminal" button:

<p align="center"><img src="https://github.com/jpivarski-talks/2024-05-22-hsf-india-tutorial-delhi/assets/1852447/9efd21b4-1cd7-45b7-80d0-a20bb0c36ac4" width="75%"></p>

In that terminal, clone this repository with

```bash
git clone https://github.com/maxgalli/2025-06-15-hsf-india-tutorial-bangalore.git
```

Each of the 4 lessons has

* `lecture-slides.ipynb`: what I'll present
* `lecture-workbook.ipynb`: what you should run to follow what I'm doing
* one or two projects with solutions: open the project when we're done with the lecture and don't peek at the solutions until you're done.

Although lesson 1 only has a physics-related problem, lessons 2, 3, and 4 have both a physics problem (all Higgs-hunting) and a non-physics problem. Choose the one that interests you!
